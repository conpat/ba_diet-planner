# ba_diet_planner

In this repository you can find the source code used for my bachelor-thesis at the University of Regensburg.


## Ready... (Requirements)
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v11.12+
[npm](https://npmjs.com/) v6.9+

## Set... (Install)

Either you use the source from the CD attached to the thesis, or (rcommended) you use the final commit from GitHub.

Install the dependencies.

```sh
$ cd ba_diet_planner
$ npm install
```

## Go... (Run it)
The CLI will give you rudimentary help about the available <commands> and <options>
```sh
$ node index.js -h
```

Basicly you can run
- a single test.
- all tests together
- prepare the date for further evaluation

#### test
With the plain `test` <command> you run all three algorithms in all possible variations.
```sh
$ node index.js test
```
Adding the planner_version option <-1/-2/-3> you run the test just for one of the algorithms. This can be usefull if you want create just the testdate for one specific algorithm.
```sh
$ node index.js test -2
```

#### prepare_data
After running the tests, the results has to be prepared and exported for further evaluation. Again you can use options for exporting results from only one algorithm.
```sh
$ node index.js data
```

## Further Reading
There are more READMEs in subdirectories. Each will document the specific directory/files.
